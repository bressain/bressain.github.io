I've been talking about starting my own software development blog for some time now but always put it off. The reason was actually kind of dumb, I simply couldn't come up with a good name for the blog. After talking to a few people I know professionally, I decided to go with dinkelburt. There's a story behind that (a really stupid one), but I'll leave that for another time.

Some goals I want to achieve with this blog are:

* Eventually create a blog that's a little more... customized to my liking that's not Blogger.
* Showcase some of the projects I'm working on.
* Share insights into things I experience in developing software.
* Inevitable ranting.

I hope something I write ends up being interesting to read as I do enjoy writing more than I care to admit. Programming daily has tried its hardest to kill off that side of my brain but it's not all dead yet. Anyway, welcome to dinkelburt and I hope you enjoy your stay.
