Remember when I [posted about losing weight](/blog/2014-02-02-adventures-in-losing-weight/) a few years ago? Remember when I posted a few disclaimers during that post? I'm feeling pretty good about those disclaimers right now because I was _**wrong**_ about a lot of the things in that post. The good news is I'm down 55 _more_ lbs and I have learned a **lot** since then.

## Lessons Learned

Let's go through the pro-tips from last time:

>Pro-tip #1: ~~Eat less calories than you burn~~

It's not that cut and dry. I have found that the type of calories really matters and doing simple calories in/calories out (CICO) only took me so far.

>Pro-tip #2: ~~Losing weight is 80% diet, 20% exercise.~~

I'm going to say at this point that it's closer to 90% diet, 10% exercise. I haven't exercised much during my latest weight loss. I _have_ watched what I ate.

>Pro-tip #3: Tracking what you eat is a powerful tool.

I think this is still true. I have more control of how much I eat when I track what I've eaten and the macros I care about.

>Pro-tip #4: Only eating what you plan to eat guarantees results.

Definitely still agree here. But while it guarantees results, I haven't needed to plan _everything_ to get results.

>Pro-tip #5: ~~Protein keeps you full much longer than carbohydrates.~~

Sort of true, but not really. Turns out it was the **fat** that came with the protein that kept me full longer.

>Pro-tip #6: ~~You’re not hungry, you’re thirsty. Drink lots of fluids so that you know for sure.~~

Turns out I was actually hungry. Fluids are important but when I eat the right things, I'm not hungry.

>Pro-tip #7: Don’t stay up late so you don’t feel the need for that “4th meal”.

Lol, yeah... I still struggle with this. Sleep is important.

>Pro-tip #8: Never drink your calories. Water is best but diet soda still has zero calories.

Still so very, very true. In fact, fruit juice is only marginally better than non-diet soda so avoid that too.

>Pro-tip #9: Measure all the things!

If you don't measure, you won't know if things are working. In fact, I've tried to take this a bit further and verify the science behind any assumptions behind what I've been doing or at least I've found some folks who do and follow them.

>Pro-tip #10: Don’t diet alone.

Having my wife join me in this way of eating has made life much easier and fulfilling for both of us. Having others join me has been helpful and encouraging as well.

## Next Adventure

So what have I been doing that has been working so well? The short answer is [keto](https://www.ruled.me/guide-keto-diet/). The long answer will be another post.
